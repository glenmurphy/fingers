The original version of Fingers ran in JavaScript, but to get to better APIs, we updated it to C#. Unfortunately, Ultraleap no-longer have C# support in the 4.1 version of their software (which was necessary for the Pimax hand tracker), but their Unity package does appear to [include a C# implementation](https://github.com/leapmotion/UnityModules/tree/develop/Assets/Plugins/LeapMotion/Core/Plugins/LeapCSharp). This directory is a copy of that directory with Unity-specific code removed.
